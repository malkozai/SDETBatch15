Loops helps us repeat instructions in code for example if we have to print the numbers from 1 to 100
one way we can do. this is by copying and pasting the code which is bad and not scalable other way of doing this is using loop.

there are 4 types of loops:

1 while
2 do while
3 for loop
4 enhanced loop

break keyword is used to stop a loop just like the condition that we used inside a loop.
continue keyword is used to skip all the code written inside the body of the loop.
we should always used break and continue with if condition
