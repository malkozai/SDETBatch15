OPP (Object Oriented Programming):
It's just a way of writing code. that follows certain rules or guideline.
we create classes that have attributes/properties/fields and methods/function/behaviourism

why we should we learn OOP? What are the advantages?
1. It simplifies the software development and maintenance(adding new features changing the existing code).
2. Code duplication is reduced.
3. It also help us represent something from real life with the help of classes and objects.

Class:
What is a Class:
it is a blueprint or a design from which actual real life objects are created. Computer uses a class to check what that class can do.
Scanner scan = new Scanner (System.in) Here Scanner is class. scan is an object of scanner class.
with the help of object we can use the methods from a class we can also use properties from that class.

Object:
Objects are created from classes, and we can use them to call methods and the properties from those classes.

Note:
Inside a class sequence does not matter you can define the methods first or the properties first.
but when we are inside a method then sequence matters.
