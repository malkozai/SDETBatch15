Nested for loop:
it is a for loop inside another for loop

Important points:

1 - in programming read the question carefully understanding the question is 50% problem solved.
2 - Always break down you problem into smaller steps always.
3 - Focus on those smaller parts test them well if they are working as per your exceptions once tested move
second part.

HOME WORKS:

1) Create an array of chars and store grades into it: A,B,C,D,E,F.
