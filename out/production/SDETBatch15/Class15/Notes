Methods in Java:
It is just a collection of java statements and blocks of code like if else loop printlns etc.

why should we learn about methods:
1. it allows us to simplify large code as we can divide the logic into smaller parts by creating methods for them for them
build those methods one by one and later on combine them to build the complete application.
2. Methods allow us to re-use code.
3. Methods allow us to be flexible.

How can we create Methods?
There are 2 types of methods. A) built-in and B) user defined.

Built-in methods?
The methods which are designed by Java developers for example the println(), nextInt(), methods in the scanner class
length() present in String class they are all built-in methods.

User Defined Methods:
The methods that we write.
Methods which return something when called and others are methods which do not return anything when called.

int add(int a, int b){
return a+b;
}
int => return types of a method
add => name of the method
(int a, int b) => parameters of the method or the input to the method
{ => body of the method
}
Rules:
return type and the values that we are returning from a method should match
we can only assign methods to variables of same type.

===========================

There are 3 types of variable with respect to their scope

1. Local Variables:
if a variable is created inside a block of code like a method, loop, if condition etc anything that has curly bracket.
they are called local variables.

Upside of Local variable:
Local variable occupy the memory for the shortest period of time. you should always try to write code with the
help of local variables.

Downside of Local Variable:
They can't be accessed outside of the block in which they are created. They have have very limited scope.

2. Instance Variables:
all the variables which are created inside a class but outside of methods are called instance variables

Upside of Instance Variables:
we can use them in all the instance method of that class. Their scope is larger than local variables.
Downside of Instance Variables:
They stay longer in the memory as compared to local variables.

3. Static Variables:
all the variables which are outside of methods and have the static keywords are called static variable


Summary:
In Java, variables can be classified into three types: local, instance, and static.
1.    Local Variables: Local variables are defined inside a method or block of code.
      They are only accessible within the method or block of code where they are declared and are not visible outside of it.
      They are also known as automatic or stack variables. They do not have a default value, so you must initialize them before using them.
2.    Instance Variables: Instance variables are defined in a class but outside of any method.
      They are associated with an instance of the class and have a default value.
      They can be accessed by any method in the class and are also known as non-static fields.
3.    Static Variables: Static variables are also defined in a class but outside of any method and are shared
      among all instances of the class. They are associated with the class itself rather than any specific instance.
      They can be accessed by any method in the class and are also known as class variables.
      They have a default value and can be accessed directly by calling className.variableName.


HOMEWORK

1) Create a method that will take 2 parameters as a numbers and prints which number is larger.
2) Create a method that will take a number and prints whether the number is even or odd.
3) Create a method that will print whether given String is palindrome or not.
4)Create a method that will say Hello in different language based on the country that will passed when method is executed
5)Write a method to return whether given number is prime or not?
6)Create  class Student that will have a method getGrade. Your method should accept the score of a student and return a grade:
score > 90 - A
score >80 - B
score >70 - C
score > 50 - D
anything else - F
