Operators:
Operators are different symbols that we can use to perform operations like addition, subtractions we can compare things if two entities are same or not if a number
is greater than the other number or not.
There are three main types of operators. They are Arithmetic operators, Relational operators and logical operators.

Arithmetic operators:

we use Arithmetic operators to perform simple math operations. like additions, subtraction etc.

The following symbols are used

+ = Addition
- = Subtraction
/ = Division
* = Multiplication
% = Modulus and remainder

Relational operators.
Relational operators are used to compare two quantities or entities. for example if something is bigger that other
thing of if two numbers are same or not of if two boolean variable contain same values or not.

== => used to check if two variables contain the same value or not if same we get true otherwise we get false.
!= => used to check if two variables don't contain the same value. we get a true if they are not same.
> => used to check if on value is greater than other value or not if greater we get a true.
< => opposite of > used to check if the value on the left is smaller than the value on right side we will get a true.
>= = if the value on left is greater than the value on right side or if they are same we will get a true.
<= = it opposite of >= and it used to check if something is less than or equal to other thing.

Conditional Constructs:
used to write conditional code. A piece of code that execute based on a condition if condition is true
that Java execute the code otherwise if skips that code.

How to write ifelse conditions:
if(condition){
 }
any line of code can be used inside the curly brackets or even another if condition
if () {
}

Important Notes:
1) for String we use equals methods instead of == sign because it is a non-primitive datatype
2) we can use command+option+l on macbook / ctrl+alt+l windows to format our code.
3) if we are confused about brackets we can click on opening or closing part to check other part.

If Else / Nested If Conditions:
If we have to test the same variable for multiple conditions i should use IF Else If.
If we have multiple conditions and these conditions are dependent on each other i should use Nested If condition.
