2D Arrays;

are Arrays that contain 1D arrays.
why we should learn about 2d arrays.
because they allow us to store multiple 1D arrays which give us more flexibility to store data.
for example if we have to store from Excel files we can use 2D arrays.

Syntax to create 2D arrays;
First Way:
DataType [][] nameOfArray = new DataType[Sizeof Rows][];
Second Way:
DataType [][] nameOfArray = {{data, data, data,},{data, data, data,},{data, data, data}};
