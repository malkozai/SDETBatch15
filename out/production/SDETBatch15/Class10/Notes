Arrays in Java:

Arrays allows us to store multiple values in a single variable. we use indexes to get back the values.

why we should learn Arrays?
if we have to store a lot values/data it become very hard to manage a lot of variables.

sytax of Arrays:

How many ways we can create arrays?
we can create in 2 different ways.

1- way of creating an Array
DataType [] name = {element no.1, element no.2, element no.3, element no.4}
in arrays no. starts from zero (0)
to access the value of element no.1 we write:
System.out.println(name[0]);

2- way of creating an Array

DataType [] name=new DataType [Size] // by default the number of data type size is always zero (0).

Notes:
other than using loops we can also use below syntax
int [] arr = {10,20,30,40,50};
// below code prints all the elements from an array without a loop
System.out.println(Arrays.toString(arr));
